# Hard Acceleration â€“ How it works on 5500 Hardware
# Verizon Telematics defines a hard acceleration event as a sudden increase in speed greater than a minimum threshold
# as configured on the 5500 unit, causing excessive force on take-off or acceleration. The minimum thresholds for hard
# acceleration are:
# Light and Medium vehicles: 7.90 MPH/s | 12.71 KPH/s (0.36g)
# Heavy vehicles: 4.82 MPH/s | 7.76 KPH/s (0.22g)
