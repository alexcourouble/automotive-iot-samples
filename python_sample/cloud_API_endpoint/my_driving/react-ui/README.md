# My Driving Frontend

The directory contains the ReactJS frontend that displays the drive events in a web-based user interface.

To run in development mode, follow the instructions bellow.


1. Start and install dependencies:

    ```
    brew install yarn
    ```
   alternately
   ```
    npm install yarn
   ```
2. Start development server:

The UI will be available on `localhost:4001`. You will need to start the API in `ui_endpoint/` and have available data in `data/cloud_db.db`.
